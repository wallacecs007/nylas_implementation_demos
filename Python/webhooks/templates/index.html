<p>This example doesn't have anything to see in the browser. Set up your
   webhook on the
   <a href="https://developer.nylas.com">Nylas Developer console</a>,
   and then watch your terminal to see the webhook notifications come in.
</p>

<p>Your webhook URL is:
  <code>{{ ngrok_url }}{{ url_for("webhook") }}</code>
</p>

<p>Once you've received at least one webhook notification from Nylas,
   you might want to check out the
   <a href="http://localhost:4040/">ngrok web interface</a>.
   That will allow you to see more information about the webhook notification,
   and replay it for testing purposes if you want.
